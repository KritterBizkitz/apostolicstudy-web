# Day 2: The First Message

**Summary:** Peter obeys the Lord’s command at Pentecost.

## 📖 Scriptures
- **Acts 2:1–4** – *Spirit poured out*  
- **Acts 2:14–36** – *Jesus preached*  
- **Acts 2:37–41** – *Repent and be baptized in Jesus’ name*

## 🔥 The Day Everything Changed

Acts chapter 2 is not just a beautiful moment—it is the birthplace of the church. This is where prophecy becomes reality. Where promise becomes power. Where the words of Jesus in Luke 24 and Acts 1 finally explode onto the scene.

> *“And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place…”*  
> *“…And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost…”* (Acts 2:1, 4)

Tongues of fire. A rushing mighty wind. A heavenly language they had never learned. This wasn’t emotionalism. This was fulfillment. This was power from on high.

## 🗣️ Peter Stands to Preach

In the midst of this supernatural outpouring, Peter stands up—not in fear, but in boldness. The same man who once denied Jesus is now preaching Him with authority.

Peter does not preach a general message about love or morality. He preaches **Jesus crucified**, **Jesus risen**, **Jesus exalted**.

> *“God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.”* (Acts 2:36)

He preached the gospel clearly and forcefully. He didn’t hold back the truth. And when the crowd heard it, something pierced their hearts.

## 💔 “What Shall We Do?”

This is the cry of conviction. This is what every preacher longs to hear:

> *“Men and brethren, what shall we do?”* (Acts 2:37)

They weren’t asking for inspiration. They were asking for instruction. Peter didn’t tell them to repeat a prayer. He didn’t tell them to accept Jesus in their heart. He gave them a direct, Spirit-filled command:

> *“Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.”* (Acts 2:38)

He said **repent**. He said **be baptized**. He said do it **in the name of Jesus Christ**. And he said it was **for the remission of sins**.

That is the message that launched the church.

## 📈 3,000 Baptized in One Day

This wasn’t just a good altar call. This was a total response. The Bible says:

> *“Then they that gladly received his word were baptized…”*  
> *“And the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.”* (Acts 2:41)

Three thousand people went down into the water. Three thousand people called on the name of Jesus. Three thousand people stepped into covenant that day.

This is not a side note in scripture. This is the main point. This is the beginning of the New Covenant church.

## 💡 The Pattern Is Set

Acts 2 establishes the blueprint:

- The gospel is preached  
- People are convicted  
- They ask, “What must we do?”  
- The answer: **repent and be baptized in Jesus’ name**  
- And they receive the Holy Ghost  

This pattern repeats throughout the book of Acts. You’ll see it in Samaria. You’ll see it in Cornelius’ house. You’ll see it in Ephesus. It all starts right here.

## 🔍 Reflection Questions

- What did Peter say baptism was **for**?
- Have I obeyed Acts 2:38 in the same way?
- If this is how the church began, is there any reason to change it now?

## 🙏 Prayer

Lord, like those on the Day of Pentecost, I ask, “What must I do?” Let me receive Your word with gladness. Let me obey without hesitation. I want to be baptized in Your name. I want to be filled with Your Spirit. Let the same fire that fell then fall in my life today. Start something new in me, just like You did in Jerusalem.
