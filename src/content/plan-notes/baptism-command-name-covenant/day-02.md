## The Day Everything Changed

The book of Acts opens like a storm rolling in. One hundred and twenty believers are waiting in an upper room because Jesus told them to wait for the promise of the Father. Then it happens:

> “And when the day of Pentecost was fully come… they were all filled with the Holy Ghost…” (Acts 2:1–4)

This moment was not random. It was the fulfillment of centuries of prophecy. Joel had spoken of it. Jesus had promised it. Now it was being poured out. Tongues of fire. A rushing mighty wind. The Holy Ghost filling men and women alike. This was the birth of the church.

## The First Sermon

When the crowd gathered and began to question what they were seeing, Peter—who had once denied Jesus—stood up under the power of the Holy Ghost. The same Peter who had been afraid of a servant girl now preached boldly to thousands.

His sermon was not about self-improvement. It was about Jesus. He declared His life, His death, His resurrection, and His exaltation. He quoted prophecy after prophecy proving that Jesus is both Lord and Christ.

By the time Peter finished, conviction pierced their hearts:

> “Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?” (Acts 2:37)

## The Answer to the Question

This is where the command of Jesus in Matthew 28:19 becomes action. Peter did not hesitate or reinterpret. He simply obeyed:

> “Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.” (Acts 2:38)

Notice that Peter did not say, “Think about baptism.” He said, “Be baptized every one of you.” And he was very specific: “in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins.”

This was not a new doctrine. This was the fulfillment of everything Jesus had just told them to preach in Luke 24:47. Repentance and remission in His name. This is the pattern.

## The Birth of the Church

Three thousand souls were baptized that day. They went down into the water calling on the name of Jesus and came up new. This was not a mere symbol. This was entry into the covenant. This was the answer to their question, “What shall we do?”

From this day forward, baptism in the name of Jesus Christ became the consistent practice of the apostles. They understood what Jesus meant when He said, “Go… baptizing them…” and they obeyed.

**Reflection Questions:**
- How does Peter’s response in Acts 2:38 align with Jesus’ command in Matthew 28:19?
- Why is the name of Jesus specifically invoked in baptism?
- Do I see baptism as the direct response to the gospel?

**Prayer:**  
Lord, let my heart be like those on the Day of Pentecost. Let me be pricked, convicted, and ready to obey. Baptize me not just in water but in Your Spirit. Let my life be a witness of the pattern You established that day.
