### Day 1: The Commission

**Summary:** Jesus’ charge and the promise of power.

## Scriptures:
- **Matthew 28:18–20** – Make disciples, baptize
- **Mark 16:15–18** – Preach, believe, be baptized
- **Luke 24:45–49** – Remission and promise
- **Acts 1:1–8** – Power to witness

## The Final Words of Jesus

If you really want to understand baptism, you have to start with the words of Jesus Himself. Before He ascended into heaven, He didn’t leave His disciples guessing. He gave a clear, unmistakable command—and it was not optional.

In Matthew 28:19, Jesus said:

> “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them…”

Mark’s gospel records it even more plainly:

> “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved…” (Mark 16:16)

That right there ought to settle something in our spirit—baptism isn’t a side issue. It’s a command from the mouth of our Savior. It is not merely a ritual or religious tradition. It is the appointed response of a believing heart to the gospel.

## Not Just a Command—A Covenant

Look again at Luke 24:47. Jesus said that **“repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations.”**

Remission. Not just forgiveness. Not just a good feeling. Remission is the removal, the canceling of a debt, the wiping away of sin’s record. And where does that happen?

Peter knew exactly what the Lord meant. That’s why when he stood on the Day of Pentecost and preached the first message under the power of the Holy Ghost, he didn’t have to stop and interpret it. He simply obeyed it.

But we’ll get to Peter in a couple days.

## You Shall Receive Power

Acts 1:8 is the setup for all that follows in the book of Acts. Jesus told them:

> “But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me…”

You cannot separate baptism from power. You cannot separate water from Spirit. The witness of the church was never meant to be a dry declaration—it was meant to be a demonstration of resurrection life. A life that has been **buried with Christ in baptism** and raised to walk in newness of life.

That’s why we’re starting here. Before we get to the apostles, before we get to doctrine, before we get to any argument or theology, we stop and listen to the voice of Jesus. He commissioned the church to baptize. And when He did, He meant it.

So as we begin this 7-day journey through the Word, don’t just read to learn. Read to obey. Read to respond. Ask the Lord to open your understanding, just as He did for the disciples in Luke 24:45. Because truth that is revealed must also be received.

**Reflection Questions:**
- Have I viewed baptism as optional or essential?
- What did Jesus actually command regarding baptism?
- Am I ready to receive power to be His witness?

**Prayer:**  
Lord, open my understanding like You did for the disciples. Let me see baptism the way You intended it—not just as a step, but as a covenant. Give me a heart that obeys, and a life that reflects the power You promised.
