## 🗣️ The Final Command of Jesus

Before Jesus ascended, He didn’t leave the church with options or suggestions—He left us with a **commission**. This wasn’t a gentle encouragement. It was a divine mandate to reach the world and baptize believers.

> *“Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them…”* (Matthew 28:19)

The commission included **teaching**, **baptizing**, and **making disciples**. Baptism wasn’t a footnote—it was central to the plan.

## 🚨 Baptism Is Not Optional

Mark records it even more directly:

> *“He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved…”* (Mark 16:16)

These are the words of Jesus. Not tradition. Not interpretation. Not a denominational creed. Straight from the mouth of the Savior. And He tied belief and baptism together in the clearest way possible.

The early church understood this. That’s why **every baptism in the book of Acts followed this model**—because it came straight from the Lord.

## 📖 Remission and the Name

Luke’s gospel gives us another layer:

> *“That repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.”* (Luke 24:47)

Let’s slow down here.

- **Repentance** is turning from sin  
- **Remission** is the canceling and removal of sin  
- And **it must be preached in His name**

Remission doesn’t happen in vague terms. It is connected to a name. And that name is **Jesus**.

When Peter stood up on the Day of Pentecost and preached baptism *in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins* (Acts 2:38), he wasn’t deviating from Jesus’ command—he was fulfilling it exactly.

## 🔥 Power to Witness

In Acts 1:8, Jesus makes another promise:

> *“But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me…”*

This is not just a motivational verse. It is the spiritual backbone of the Great Commission. The power of the Spirit and the act of baptism are woven together throughout the entire book of Acts. You can’t separate the command from the experience.

Jesus said go. Jesus said baptize. Jesus said you’ll receive power.

## 🔁 What Do We Learn?

From just these four passages, we learn:

- Baptism is part of the Great Commission  
- It is a response to belief  
- It is tied to remission of sins  
- It is done in **the name of Jesus**  
- It is part of the **apostolic pattern** of salvation  
- And it is **empowered by the Spirit**

This is not a side issue. This is the foundation.

## 🔍 Reflection Questions

- Have I treated baptism as optional, or as essential?  
- Do I see it as part of the original gospel plan Jesus gave?  
- Have I been baptized the way Jesus and the apostles commanded?

## 🙏 Prayer

Lord Jesus, open my understanding like You did for the disciples. Let me see baptism not as a formality but as a part of Your covenant. Give me a heart that obeys Your command, a mind that is renewed by truth, and a spirit that is ready to walk in Your power. I want everything You have for me—nothing held back.
