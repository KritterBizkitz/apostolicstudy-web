# Day 3: The Pattern Spreads

**Summary:** Samaritans and the Ethiopian respond to the gospel.

## 📖 Scriptures
- **Acts 8:4–17** – *Believed and baptized*
- **Acts 8:26–39** – *See, here is water*

## 🔥 When the Gospel Moved Beyond Jerusalem

The church didn’t stay in Jerusalem. Persecution caused the believers to scatter, but the Word of God went with them. What looked like chaos was actually the fulfillment of Jesus’ command: *“ye shall be witnesses unto me… in Samaria…”* (Acts 1:8).

And right there, in Samaria—once a place of conflict and rejection—the gospel found fertile ground.

## ✝️ The Revival in Samaria

Philip, one of the seven chosen in Acts 6, preached Christ in Samaria. Notice what happened:

> “But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, **they were baptized**, both men and women.” (Acts 8:12)

They believed the message. They responded with baptism.

This isn’t symbolic. This is consistent. From the very beginning, believing the gospel was **followed by** water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ.

Even more, the apostles in Jerusalem sent Peter and John to lay hands on the new believers so they might receive the Holy Ghost. This shows clearly that **baptism and Spirit infilling are not the same thing**—both are essential, and both were expected.

## 🧭 The Ethiopian Eunuch

Later in the same chapter, the Lord sends Philip again—this time, to the middle of a desert road where a man is reading from Isaiah.

This eunuch is a high-ranking official from Ethiopia. He’s hungry for truth. He’s reading scripture but doesn’t yet understand. God puts a preacher in his path.

Philip preaches Jesus to him, beginning at Isaiah 53. And the eunuch’s response?

> “See, **here is water**; what doth hinder me to be baptized?” (Acts 8:36)

There was no hesitation. No argument. No debate about whether baptism was necessary. Philip didn’t have to convince him. When Jesus was preached, **baptism in His name** was the immediate, obvious response.

And they went down into the water together.

> “And he baptized him.” (Acts 8:38)

No long discipleship class. No ceremonial delay. Just revelation followed by obedience.

## 🌊 The Pattern Holds

We are seeing a pattern take shape:

- The gospel is preached  
- The name of Jesus is lifted up  
- People believe and respond  
- They are baptized in water  
- They seek and receive the Holy Ghost

This is not just how it happened in Jerusalem. It’s how it happened in Samaria. It’s how it happened on a desert road with one man in a chariot.

And it’s still how it happens today.

## 🔍 Reflection Questions

- Have I allowed tradition or fear to delay my response to truth?
- Do I see baptism as the *next step* after believing the gospel?
- What hinders me from obeying what I see in scripture?

## 🙏 Prayer

Lord, I want to follow the pattern You set in Your Word. Let nothing hinder me—not tradition, not fear, not pride. Just like the eunuch, help me say, “Here is water.” Give me a heart that is ready, a mind that is open, and a spirit that is eager to obey. Let Your name be lifted up in my life, and let the fullness of Your gospel work in me.
