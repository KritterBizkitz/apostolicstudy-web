## 💧 Baptism Is Not Just a Symbol

One of the most dangerous ideas in modern Christianity is that baptism is *just* an outward sign. That it’s optional. That it’s secondary. That it doesn’t actually do anything.

But the apostles never preached it that way.

Peter, the same man who preached Acts 2:38, wrote in his first epistle:

> *“…baptism doth also now save us…”* (1 Peter 3:21)

He didn’t say baptism is a nice tradition. He didn’t say it’s just for church membership. He said **it saves us**. And he ties it directly to Noah’s ark—an image of salvation through water, not from it.

The ark didn’t save Noah *from* the water. The ark saved him *by* the water. And baptism, Peter says, is that same figure.

## 🧼 The Washing of Regeneration

Paul echoes this idea in his letter to Titus:

> *“Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration…”* (Titus 3:5)

Salvation is not earned by good deeds, church attendance, or moral effort. It comes through **the washing**, a supernatural cleansing, a rebirth that takes place in baptism. It is part of God’s mercy-plan, not man’s merit.

## 🧱 One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism

Ephesians 4 reminds us that there is a divine unity in the plan of God:

> *“One Lord, one faith, one baptism…”* (Ephesians 4:5)

Not many baptisms. Not multiple options. Not different formulas. There is **one baptism**—the one that was commanded by Jesus, preached by the apostles, and practiced throughout the book of Acts. That baptism is in the name of Jesus Christ, and it is not negotiable.

## ⚖️ Washed. Sanctified. Justified.

In 1 Corinthians 6, Paul lists a long line of sins that once defined the church in Corinth. But then he says this:

> *“And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.”* (1 Corinthians 6:11)

That is the full gospel. Washed in His name. Sanctified by His Spirit. Justified in His righteousness. It is water and Spirit, together.

And again, it is **the name** that brings cleansing.

## 🩸 A Cleansed Conscience

Hebrews 10 speaks about what happens on the inside when we obey the gospel:

> *“Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.”* (Hebrews 10:22)

Baptism is not only about what happens on the outside. It is about the **cleansing of the conscience**. It is our appeal to God—not based on works or effort—but based on faith in His Word.

## 🙏 Prayer

Lord Jesus, thank You for the washing of regeneration. Thank You for inviting me into covenant through Your name. Let me never minimize what You have commanded. Let me never treat baptism lightly. I want to be washed, sanctified, justified, and made new—completely Yours, completely clean. Let my life be rooted in the one faith, the one name, and the one baptism You gave Your church.
