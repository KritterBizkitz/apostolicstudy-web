## ⚡ A Dramatic Encounter

Few people hated the name of Jesus more than Saul of Tarsus. He was a Pharisee trained under Gamaliel, zealous for the Law, and determined to destroy this new movement of believers. But on the road to Damascus, everything changed.

> “And suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven. And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?” (Acts 9:3–4)

The one Saul had been fighting against was the very Lord of glory. In that moment, Saul realized he was not defending truth—he was fighting against it.

## 👀 Blind but Not Forsaken

Blinded by the heavenly light, Saul is led by the hand into Damascus. For three days he neither eats nor drinks. Imagine the turmoil in his heart: all his learning, all his zeal, and yet he was wrong about Jesus. This is the state of so many who are sincere but misinformed. Sincerity is not salvation. Saul needed more than conviction. He needed conversion.

God sends Ananias, a humble disciple, with a message and a mission. Ananias lays hands on Saul and calls him “Brother.” The scales fall from his eyes. He is filled with the Holy Ghost. And what is the immediate next step?

## 💦 Rise and Be Baptized

Acts 9:18 says:

> “And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.”

Then, later, Paul recounts his conversion in his own words:

> “And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.” (Acts 22:16)

There it is. Baptism in Jesus’ name is not just for the “new believer” or the “outsider.” It was commanded for the most religious, the most learned, the most zealous. Even Saul, who would become the Apostle Paul, had to go down in the water in the name of Jesus to have his sins washed away.

## 🌊 Conversion, Not Just Confession

This moment in Saul’s life shows us something critical. A powerful encounter with Jesus, visions, supernatural light, even being filled with the Spirit—all of it pointed him toward one thing: **baptism in the name of Jesus Christ.**

It wasn’t optional. It wasn’t delayed. It wasn’t “symbolic.” It was immediate and necessary. Saul’s testimony is a model for anyone who thinks they are “close enough” to God already. If Saul had to obey, so do we.

## 🔍 Reflection Questions

- Do I believe that powerful spiritual experiences alone are enough without baptism?
- What does Saul’s immediate baptism say about the urgency of obeying the gospel?
- Am I willing to let go of my background, pride, or tradition to obey God fully?

## 🙏 Prayer

Lord, strip away anything in me that resists Your Word. Like Saul, I want my eyes opened. Help me to rise, be baptized, and call upon Your name without delay. Let me walk in true conversion, not just conviction.
