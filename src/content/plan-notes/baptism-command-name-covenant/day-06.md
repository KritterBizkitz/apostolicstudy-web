# Day 6: The Name and the Covenant

**Summary:** Baptism is done in the name that saves, and it brings us into covenant.

## 📖 Scriptures
- **Acts 4:10–12** – *No other name under heaven*  
- **Acts 19:1–7** – *Re-baptized in the name of Jesus*  
- **Romans 6:3–5** – *Buried with Him in baptism*  
- **Galatians 3:26–27** – *Put on Christ*  
- **Colossians 2:11–13** – *Spiritual circumcision in baptism*

## 🔐 The Power Is in the Name

In Acts 4, Peter makes a bold declaration:

> *“Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.”* (Acts 4:12)

That name, of course, is **Jesus**.

Now think about this—if there is *no other name that saves*, why would baptism be performed in any other name? The apostles understood that when Jesus said to baptize in the name, He was referring to **His name**.

They never once baptized using a formula that quoted the titles *Father, Son, and Holy Ghost*. They baptized in **the name of Jesus Christ**, because Jesus is the name of the Father (John 5:43), the name of the Son (Matthew 1:21), and the name in which the Holy Ghost comes (John 14:26).

## 🔁 Re-baptism? Yes.

In Acts 19, Paul finds some disciples in Ephesus who had already been baptized—but only with John’s baptism. That was a baptism of repentance, not of the name or of the covenant.

Paul asks:

> *“Unto what then were ye baptized?”*  
> They respond, *“Unto John's baptism.”*

Then Paul explains that John’s baptism was only the forerunner. And what happens next?

> *“When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.”* (Acts 19:5)

These were believers. Sincere. God-fearing. But their previous baptism wasn’t enough—not because it wasn’t heartfelt, but because it wasn’t **in the name**.

They didn’t just need a spiritual touch. They needed covenant baptism.

## ⚰️ Buried with Christ

Romans 6 gives us the spiritual depth of what baptism actually is:

> *“Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?”*  
> *“Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death…”* (Romans 6:3–4)

Baptism is not a church tradition. It is a burial. It is a participation in the death of Christ. It is where the old man dies, where sin is buried, and where resurrection life begins.

No burial means no resurrection. That’s why we must be **baptized into Him**.

## 👕 Putting on Christ

Galatians 3:27 continues the thought:

> *“For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.”*

This is identity. This is covering. This is transformation. When you are baptized into Jesus’ name, you don’t just join a church—you take on the name of the One who died for you.

You become His.

## ✂️ The Circumcision of Christ

In the Old Testament, circumcision was the sign of the covenant. But in the New Testament, Paul reveals that baptism has become the *spiritual circumcision* that identifies us as part of the covenant people.

> *“…ye are complete in him… In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands… buried with him in baptism…”* (Colossians 2:10–12)

Baptism in Jesus’ name is not merely an outward act—it is the inward cutting away of the old nature, the initiation into the covenant of grace.

## 🔍 Reflection Questions

- Do I see baptism as a burial, or just a ritual?
- Have I been baptized in the name that is above every name?

## 🙏 Prayer

Jesus, I thank You for revealing the power of Your name. Let me never treat baptism as common. Let me honor the cross by being buried with You in Your name. Cut away my past, bury my sin, and raise me up to walk in covenant with You. I want to wear Your name. I want to walk in Your power.
