## 🌍 A Gentile Seeks God

The gospel had reached Jerusalem, Samaria, and even a desert road—but now, in Acts 10, the door is about to open wider than anyone expected.

Cornelius is a Roman centurion. He’s a Gentile, a soldier, and an outsider. But the Bible says he was *“a devout man, and one that feared God with all his house…”* (Acts 10:2)

He gave generously. He prayed continually. He fasted. But none of those things equaled salvation. They were good, but they weren’t enough.

He needed more than religion—he needed **revelation**.

## 📩 God Sends a Messenger

While Cornelius is praying, God gives him a vision. An angel tells him to send for Simon Peter, who will tell him what he must do.

At the same time, God is dealing with Peter’s heart through a vision of unclean animals. The Lord speaks and says:

> *“What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.”* (Acts 10:15)

Peter didn’t realize yet that this vision wasn’t about animals—it was about people. God was preparing him to walk into the house of someone his culture had always considered unclean. And once Peter obeys and enters Cornelius’ home, everything changes.

## 🕊️ The Holy Ghost Falls

Peter begins to preach Jesus. He lifts up the name. He declares the death, burial, and resurrection. And as he is preaching, **the Holy Ghost falls** on everyone in the house.

> *“For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God…”* (Acts 10:46)

This moment stunned the Jewish believers. Gentiles had just received the same gift they had received at Pentecost. But Peter doesn’t stop there. He immediately gives a clear command:

> *“Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized...?”*  
> *“And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.”* (Acts 10:47–48)

No waiting period. No argument. The Spirit and water work together. One confirms the other.

## ✅ God Confirms It

Later, when Peter is questioned about what happened, he recounts it clearly:

> *“Then remembered I the word of the Lord... John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.”*  
> *“Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us... what was I, that I could withstand God?”* (Acts 11:16–17)

The other apostles heard it and glorified God, saying:

> *“Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.”* (Acts 11:18)

This was more than a good church service. This was the fulfillment of God’s plan for all people—Jews and Gentiles alike—to be born again of water and Spirit, baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.

## 🔍 Reflection Questions

- What does this story show us about salvation being more than just sincerity or good works?
- Why was baptism still necessary *after* they received the Holy Ghost?
- Do I believe God is still calling outsiders into the covenant today?

## 🙏 Prayer

Lord, thank You for breaking down every wall that separated us from You. Let me never settle for religious routine when You are calling me to full obedience. I want all that You have for me—just like Cornelius. Fill me with Your Spirit. Baptize me in Your name. Let Your full plan unfold in my life, without delay or hesitation.
